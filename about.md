# About Nikola [_Никола, 有为_]

Hello. My name is Nikola Janjušević. I am a second
year **PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering** at New York University under
the advisory of Professor Yao Wang at the [NYU VideoLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/). 
My current interests are in *sparse representation-learning*, *deep-learning*,
*wavelets*, and *optimization*.  Outside of academia I spend my time
skateboarding with my brother and my friends and occasionally taking photos.
