Hello. My name is Nikola Janjušević. I am a second year **PhD candidate in
Electrical Engineering** at *New York University* under the advisory of
Professor Yao Wang at the [NYU VideoLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/).  I
received my Bachelors in Engineering from *The Cooper Union for Advancement of
Science and Art*.

My current interests are in *sparse representation-learning*, *deep-learning via algorithm unrolling*, and *optimization*. Outside of academia I spend my time
skateboarding with my brother and my friends and occasionally taking photos.
