Hello. My name is Nikola JanjuÅ¡eviÄ‡. I am a third year **PhD candidate in
Electrical Engineering** at *New York University* under the advisory of
Professor Yao Wang, [NYU VideoLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/). I
received my Bachelors in Electrical Engineering from *The Cooper Union for Advancement of
Science and Art* in 2019.

My current interests are in *interpretable deep-learning* models for *linear inverse-problems* and low-level *computer-vision*/*image-processing* tasks. My background is in *signal-processing* and *non-smooth, convex optimization*. Outside of academia, I go skateboarding with my friends ðŸ›¹.
