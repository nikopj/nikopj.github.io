Hello. My name is Nikola Janjušević. I am a Post Doctoral Researcher at NYU
Langone Department of Radiology. I earned my PhD in Electrical
Engineering from *New York University* under the advisory of Professor Yao Wang,
[NYU VideoLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/videolab/), in 2024. I received my Bachelors in
Electrical Engineering from *The Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and
Art* in 2019.

My current interests are in constructing *interpretable deep-learning* models for solving
noisy MRI reconstruction problems without ground-truth data. My
background is in *signal-processing*, *non-smooth convex optimization*, and deep-learning.
Outside of academia, I go climbing, biking, and skateboarding with my friends.
