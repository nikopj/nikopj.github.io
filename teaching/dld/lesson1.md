## Numbering Systems
### Base 10 (decimal)

The base 10 system uses a total of 10 symbols (known as **digits**) in its (ordered) alphabet,

$$ \mathcal{A} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ,8, 9\}.$$

We express numbers via a combination of one or more of these symbols. Below we show how
a decimal number written as a chain of symbols from the alphabet is implicitly represented 
using its base.

<!-- \example{A decimal integer}{ -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!--     1209_{10} = 1 \times 10^3 + 2 \times 10^2 + 0 \times 10^1 + 9 \times 10^0  -->
<!-- $$ -->
<!-- } -->
\figenv{Numbering systems terminology.}{/assets/dld/imgs/numbering_terminology.png}{width:70%}

The position of each symbol encodes a **weighting factor** that is the base number 
raised to the power of the position. Fractional values are similarly represented by 
considering positions after the decimal point as negative indexed positions.

\example{A decimal number with fractional part}{
$$
    3.141_{10} = 3 \times 10^0 + 1 \times 10^{-1} + 4 \times 10^{-2} + 1 \times 10^{-3}
$$
}

By convention, we call the left most digit the **most significant digit** as it
is associated with the largest weighting factor. Similarly, the right most is
called the **least significant digit**. Note that arithmetic between two numbers 
may change the number symbols required for representation, ex. $5_{10} + 6_{10} = 11_{10}$.

- What is the largest number we can represent with only 3 digits?

### Base 2 (binary)
The use of 10 symbols in our decimal number system is somewhat arbitrary. 
What happens when we change our alphabet size to 2, i.e. $\mathcal{A} =
\{0,1\}$? How would we represent our familiar decimal numbers? 

\example{five in binary}{
    \begin{eqnarray}
    101_2 &=& 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 \\
          &=& 4 + 1 \\
          &=& 5_{10}
    \end{eqnarray}
}

Again, the weighting factor is base of our number system (2) raised to 
the power of the symbol's position.
We call the symbols in binary **bits**.

\reference{three bit numbers}{
    \begin{eqnarray}
    0_{10} &=& 000_2 &~& 4_{10} &=& 100_2 \\
    1_{10} &=& 001_2 &~& 5_{10} &=& 101_2 \\
    2_{10} &=& 010_2 &~& 6_{10} &=& 110_2 \\
    3_{10} &=& 011_2 &~& 7_{10} &=& 111_2 
    \end{eqnarray}
}

We've already seen how to convert from binary to decimal using 
weighting factors. How about from decimal to binary? An intuitive way 
is to start with the largest power of 2 that fits into the number, and keep including powers of 2 until you've met the decimal number, 

\example{intuitive decimal to binary}{
$$ 67_{10} = 64 + 2 + 1 = 2^6 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 0100~0011_2.$$

It's best to keep binary in groups of four bits for legibility, hence the leading zero.
}

A more algorithmic method for binary to decimal is to repeatedly divide
the decimal number by two, recording the remainder, until zero is reached.

\example{sucessive division}{
    \begin{eqnarray}
    67 \div 2 &=& 33, ~ &\text{rem.}& &1& ~\text{(LSB)} \\
    33 \div 2 &=& 16, ~ &\text{rem.}& &1& \\
    16 \div 2 &=& 8, ~  &\text{rem.}& &0& \\
    8 \div 2 &=& 4, ~  &\text{rem.}&  &0& \\
    4 \div 2 &=& 2, ~  &\text{rem.}&  &0& \\
    2 \div 2 &=& 1, ~  &\text{rem.}&  &0& \\
    1 \div 2 &=& 0, ~  &\text{rem.}&  &1& ~\text{(MSB)}\\
    \end{eqnarray}

Hence, $67_{10} = 0100~0011_2$.
}

- Binary fractions: sucessive multiplication.
- What' the largest number you can represent with $N$ bits?

### Base 8 (octal) and Base 16 (hexadecimal)
\reference{Common bases to 16}{
    \begin{eqnarray}
    \text{decimal} &~& \text{binary} &~& \text{octal} &~& \text{hex} \\\hline
    0  &~& 0000 &~& 00 &~& 0 \\
    1  &~& 0001 &~& 01 &~& 1 \\
    2  &~& 0010 &~& 02 &~& 2 \\
    3  &~& 0011 &~& 03 &~& 3 \\\hline
    4  &~& 0100 &~& 04 &~& 4 \\
    5  &~& 0101 &~& 05 &~& 5 \\    
    6  &~& 0110 &~& 06 &~& 6 \\
    7  &~& 0111 &~& 07 &~& 7 \\\hline
    8  &~& 1000 &~& 10 &~& 8 \\
    9  &~& 1001 &~& 11 &~& 9 \\
    10 &~& 1010 &~& 12 &~& A \\
    11 &~& 1011 &~& 13 &~& B \\\hline
    12 &~& 1100 &~& 14 &~& C \\
    13 &~& 1101 &~& 15 &~& D \\
    14 &~& 1110 &~& 16 &~& E \\
    15 &~& 1111 &~& 17 &~& F 
    \end{eqnarray}
}

Note that hexadecimal and octal have alphabet sizes of 16 and 8 respectivley.
Our arabic digits don't go past nine, so we have to start using new symbols for hex.

An easy way to convert between hex and binary is by dealing with groups of 4 bits. Similarly octal numbers and 3 bits.

\figenv{Hex <-> binary <-> octal conversion.}{/assets/dld/imgs/hex_convert.png}{width:50%}

### Binary Coded Decimal (BCD)
BCD represents each digit in a number separately in 4 bit binary.
\example{bcd}{
```
decimal           BCD
-------      --------------
  950   <--> 1001 0101 0000
```
}
Note: some bit patterns are invalid in BCD, ex. `1011` does not 
correspond to any decimal symbol.

It is useful for displaying information and interfacing with displays.

## Arithmetic
The same tools of arithmetic you're familiar with in decimal carry over to other number systems.
Most importantly, the tool of "carrying" extra symbols from one position to the next significant 
position when addition overflows.
\figenv{Binary addition.}{/assets/dld/imgs/carry.png}{width:50%}

- to extend your understanding, try:
    * hex/octal addition/subtraction (without converting to binary)
    * binary multiplication
    * (hint) work through examples in decimal if you're stuck

### Negative Numbers
How can we represent negative numbers? In everyday (decimal) life we use an 
extra symbol, the negative sign, ex. $-42$. We call this representation 
**sign-magnitude**, and in binary it is represented by the MSB indicating 
the precense of a negative sign a.k.a the **sign-bit**.

\example{sign-magnitude binary}{
$$
1110_2 = \underbrace{1}_{\text{sign}}\overbrace{110_2}^{\text{magnitude}} = -6_{10}
$$
}

- Given $N$ bits, what's the range of numbers spanned by a sign-magnitude representation?

Another (more common) way of representing sign in binary is via **Two's
Complement**. In this representation, the weighting factor of the MSB is given
a negative sign. Negation is conviently achieved by flipping bits and adding one.

\example{two's complement}{
$$
1110_2 = -2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = -2_{10}
$$
$$
\overset{\text{flip}}{\rightarrow} ~ 0001_2 ~ 
\overset{\text{+1}}{\rightarrow} ~ 0010_2 = 2_{10}
$$
}

This has the following benefits over sign-magnitude:
- no negative zero, larger range 
- subtraction is equivalent to negation + addition (only one circuit required: addition)

\example{two's complement subtraction}{
We verify that addition arithmetic works two's complement numbers.
Note that the final carry bit is ignored by design.
```
decimal         sign-mag.      2's comp.     decimal
-------        -----------    -----------    --------
           carry:              111 1   1
  45 =>          0010 1101 =>   0010 1101 
- 23           - 0001 0111    + 1110 1001
====           ===========    ===========
  22                           10001 0110
        ignore overflow:        0001 0110 => 22
```
}

A downside of two's complement is that underflow/overflow must be manually 
checked before computation begins, as opposed to being indicated via a carry bit.
This is due to the "wrap-around" nature of the representation which is 
required for its nice arithmetic properties. For example, in two's complement,

$$7_{10} + 1_{10} = 0111_2 + 0001_2 = 1000_2 = -8_{10}.$$
